    description:
      Shows raid statistics for the inputted username.
      Note that DE hasn't been tracking this data forever.
      So some really old raids won't be shown due to having no data.
      The shortest raid time shown only counts victorious raids.

      Items with no current sell offers are listed first.

      This command is used to help you decide what to sell in case you have to much standing.
      For price checking refer to `wfpricecheck` aka. `wfpc` instead.
